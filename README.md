 <h3> We are hiring developers that know - C++, Javascript and LUA </h1>

You may think that we just 'popped up' from no-where but we have been around since 2018 and actively involved in the cheating community.
In the past we have made lots of cheats - our most popular one (Vengance) which was made in 2021 was a cheat for valorant which has
now been discontinued. 

Games we have previously made cheats for:
- Valorant (Discontinued) [2021]
- Fortnite (Discontinued) [2022]
- CS:GO (Discontinued) [2018]
- TF2 (Discontinued) [2021]

Current execution tools:
- Roblox (In development)

Our team:
- Swpt
- FireKrill
- qFlux

Our goals: 
To bypass a certain little anti-tamper made by the wonderfull people at by4r0n t3cknologises to gives developers (or players *hint* *hint*) 
the tools to help with game development. To make this tool for developers our primary mission is to make a level 7 un-restricted luau execution
for developers.

Our mission:
To provide quality cheats and tools to players and developers around the world.

Our standards are pretty high - if it doesn't meet the quality expectations then we do not release it.
